### Here's a breakdown of your Jetpack Compose Android Expense Tracker project in bullet points:

## App Initialization & Architecture
    Built in Kotlin with Jetpack Compose, following modern Android app standards.
    Adopts MVVM or Clean / Domain‑layer architecture with ViewModel, use cases, repository, and DI using Hilt or Koin 
    Persists local data with Room Database, allowing fully offline usage 
    Manages async data flows using Kotlin Coroutines and Flow / StateFlow 

## Home / Dashboard Screen
    Displays a list of user expenses, grouped by date or category, using a LazyColumn or equivalent Compose list.
    Provides a quick overview of total expenses per category and date; may include summary stats on spending 
    Offers navigation to add, edit, or delete an expense entry.

## Add / Edit Expense Screen
    Allows users to add new expenses with fields: amount, category (e.g. Food, Travel), date, optional notes.
    Supports editing and removing existing entries.
    Includes input validation (e.g. non-zero amount, category selection).

## Stats & Visualization
    Presents visual analytics of spending via bar charts, pie charts, or date-based summaries.
    Charts are rendered with Compose–compatible libraries or custom Canvas APIs 
    Summarizes spending habits — total outlay, category breakdown, trends over time.

## Navigation
    Manages app navigation using Compose Navigation (NavHost / NavController).
    Defines a navigation graph for smooth transitions between Home, Add/Edit screens, and Stats view 

## Additional Features & Settings
    Allows filtering or sorting expenses by date, amount, or category.
    Persist user settings using Room or DataStore (e.g. default currency, theme) 
    Optional settings view for configuring preferences or clearing data.

## Technical Stack Summary
    UI: Jetpack Compose, Material3 for modern and responsive design.
    Local data: Room Database for structured offline storage.
    Architecture: MVVM, optionally Clean Architecture layers.
    Networking: none required—data lives locally.
    DI: Dagger Hilt (or equivalent) to decouple components and support testability 
    Concurrency: Coroutines + StateFlow / Flow for reactive state management.
