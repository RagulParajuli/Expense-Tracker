### Here's a breakdown of your Jetpack Compose Android Expense Tracker project in bullet points:

## App Initialization & Architecture
        -The app is built using Kotlin with XML-based layouts.
        -Follows MVVM architecture with clear separation between UI (Activity/Fragment), data (Room), and business logic (ViewModel).

## Home / Dashboard Screen
    *Displays a list of expenses using RecyclerView.
    *Shows each expense entry with:
        -Amount
        -Category (e.g. Food, Transport)
        -Date
        -Description or note
    *Includes a FloatingActionButton (FAB) to add new expenses.
    *Uses a Room database to retrieve and display all stored expenses in real time.

## Add Expense:
    *A separate activity or dialog opens when user clicks on the FAB.
    *Input fields allow the user to:
        -Enter amount
        -Select category from dropdown/spinner
        -Pick date using a DatePickerDialog
        -Enter a description or note
    *Input validation ensures fields are not empty or invalid before saving.
    *On save, the data is inserted into the Room database and reflected immediately on the home screen.

## Edit & Delete Expense:
    *Tapping an existing expense opens it for editing.
    *Users can:
        -Update amount, category, or date
        -Delete the expense entry permanently
    *Changes are saved back to the Room database using DAO methods.

## Summary & Statistics (Optional or Planned):
    *May include a summary section showing:
        -Total spending
        -Spending by category
        -Monthly breakdown
    *Optionally could use PieChart or BarChart (MPAndroidChart) to visualize data.

## Navigation:
    -Basic navigation between activities is handled using explicit Intents.
    -UI flow: MainActivity ↔ AddExpenseActivity ↔ EditExpenseActivity (if implemented).
